        /*

         * According to BODMAS (or PEMDAS), the order is:**

         Brackets
         Orders (powers, roots)
         Division
         Multiplication
         Addition
         Subtraction
         **However, Multiplication and Division have the same precedence.**
         When both appear together (without brackets),most programming languages evaluates them from left to right.

         that is why we don't have division first instead multiplication
