     * #### Keywords
     * - Keywords are reserved words in Java that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used for naming variables,
     * - methods, classes, or other identifiers.
     * - Identifiers, on the other hand, are names that you create to identify variables, methods, classes, and other entities in your code.
     * - Identifiers must follow certain rules,such as starting with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($), and cannot be the same as keywords.
     * - In the provided code, `package`, `public`, `class`, and `static` are keywords, while
     * - `Lab007_Keywords_Identifier` and `main` are identifiers.
     * - Simple English words** which are having predefined meaning in **Java Programming Language.**
     * - Keywords are also called **Reserved Words.**
     * - All the keywords are defined in **Lower Case.  **
     * - We **canâ€™t use keywords** as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifiers.
